# General Info

Start comments with the `;` character. Everything from this character until the end of the line will be skipped. However, feel free to use this character in strings or symbol names (just don't use it as the first character of a symbol name).

You can name symbols almost anything you want; the only things that are not allowed in symbol names are whitespace, a digit first character, or a `;` first character.
